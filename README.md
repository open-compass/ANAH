## ‚ú® Introduction

### ANAH: Analytical Annotation of Hallucinations in Large Language Models

[![arXiv](https://img.shields.io/badge/arXiv-2405.20315-b31b1b.svg)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20315)

ANAH is a bilingual dataset that offers analytical annotation of hallucinations in LLMs within generative question answering.

Each answer sentence in our dataset undergoes rigorous annotation, involving the retrieval of a reference fragment, the judgment of the hallucination type, and the correction of hallucinated content.

ANAH consists of ~12k sentence-level annotations for ~4.3k LLM responses covering over 700 topics, constructed by a human-in-the-loop pipeline.

### ANAH-v2: Scaling Analytical Hallucination Annotation of Large Language Models

ANAH-v2 is a scalable framework for the oversight of LLM hallucinations.

Through iterative self-training, we simultaneously and progressively scale up the hallucination annotation dataset and improve the accuracy of the hallucination annotator.

The final dataset encompasses both over ‚àº3k topics, ‚àº196k model responses, and ‚àº822k annotated sentences, in English and Chinese.

## ü§ó HuggingFace Model & Dataset
<a name="huggingface-dataset"></a>
### Dataset

The ANAH dataset is available on Huggingface dataset hub.

| Dataset | Huggingface Repo |
|---------|------------------|
| ANAH    | [Dataset Link](https://huggingface.co/datasets/opencompass/anah) |

We also release the topics, questions and reference documents of ANAH-v2, you can find it [here](https://github.com/open-compass/ANAH/blob/main/eval/anah_v2/question_document.jsonl).

### Model

ANAH can be used for training hallucination annotators. 

We have trained the annotators based on InternLM2 series models.

The annotator models are available on Huggingface model hub.

| Model    | Huggingface Repo |
|----------|------------------|
| ANAH-7B  | [Model Link](https://huggingface.co/opencompass/anah-7b)  |
| ANAH-20B | [Model Link](https://huggingface.co/opencompass/anah-20b)  |
| ANAH-v2  | [Model Link](https://huggingface.co/opencompass/anah-v2) |


You have to follow the prompt in our paper to annotate the hallucination. Note that ANAH and ANAH-v2 use completely different prompts.

We recommand you to use the more advanced annotator ANAH-v2 and its prompt can be found [here](https://github.com/open-compass/ANAH/blob/main/prompt_v2.py).

We also provide some [examples](https://github.com/open-compass/ANAH/blob/main/example) of using the ANAH-v2 annotator, which you can refer to for annotating your content.

## üèóÔ∏è Ô∏èEvaluation for the hallucinations level of LLM-generated content.

ANAH-v2 is a nice hallucination annotator that can be used to assess the level of hallucinations in LLM-generated content.

### 1. Responses Generation

For the models you want to evaluate, collect their responses under some questions. We recommend that you use the questions from the [ANAH-v2 dataset](https://github.com/open-compass/ANAH/blob/main/eval/anah_v2/question_document.jsonl), but you can also use your custom questions. Then, construct your model response file in the following format:

```json
{"question": "...", "response": "..."}
{"question": "...", "response": "..."}
```


### 2. Hallucination Score Evaluation

Put the path to the model response file you just got into `{your_model_response_path}`. Then run the following command. You can get the hallucination annotation result in `{your_annotation_result_path}` and the factuality score (higher score means lower level of hallucination) in `{your_evaluation_result_path}`.

```bash
python -u ./eval/anah_v2/eval.py \
    --json_path {your_model_response_path} \ 
    --annotation_path {your_annotation_result_path} \
    --eval_path {your_evaluation_result_path} \
```

Note that if you are using the customized questions, you will need to prepare a `question_document` file to be entered as `--document_path`. You can refer to the format of [this file](https://github.com/open-compass/ANAH/blob/main/eval/anah_v2/question_document.jsonl) to organize your file.

## üèóÔ∏è Ô∏èEvaluation for LLMs' ability to generate fine-grained hallucination annotation.

ANAH can be used for evaluating the current open-source and close-source LLMs' ability to generate fine-grained hallucination annotation.

### 1. Environment Setup

We recommend you use `Python 3.10` and `Pytorch 1.13.1`.

```bash
conda create --name anah python=3.10.13
conda activate anah
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Inference and Evaluation

We now support the evaluation of the InternLM2, Llama2, Qwen, and Baichuan2 series of open-source models.

We use LMdeploy for model deployment and inference. If you want to test more models, you can refer to [LMDeploy](https://github.com/InternLM/lagent) for relevant configuration.

We recommend you download the huggingface model to your local path and replace the `{your_hf_model_path}` to that path.

Our evaluations are conducted on NVIDIA A100 GPUs, and OOM may occur on other types of machines.

```bash
python -u ./eval/anah_v1/eval.py \
    --model_type {your_model_type} \ 
    --server_addr {your_hf_model_path} \
    --json_path {test_set_path} \
    --output_path {your_inference_results_path} \
    --eval_sorce_path {your_evaluation_result_path} \
```
